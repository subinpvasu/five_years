The BTW Dive works as follows

1.It is developed using the framework CodeIgniter.
2.In the BTW Dive Folder, there is a folder named "diver Important Files" which is the files for the diver login section.
3.Copy the BTWdive to a folder will not perform the diver login successfully.so you have to copy the entire file to a new folder in the same parent folder of BTWdive names "Diver" and copy the files and replace the ,controller,model and views from the seperate folder.now, both suystem will work fine.

hope you have basic idea about CI.
